  ChangeLog
  =========

This is a detailed list of ongoing changes.  Add changes to 
the top of this file.
	
* changes leading to March 1 2002 version
_________________________________________	

TaAnalysisManager -
   Can choose now between two type of analysis, so now the run type and the anatype could
   be different. We still need to put the ana type in the root file name.
	 
	
VaAnalysis -
   Added RunInI() set the value of fEHelDequeMax at 1 in case of no 
   helicity delay. This was the main problem why we didn't have 
   the pair tree after a run.	

TaEvent -
   private variable FirstPS was set to 1 to respect the source 
   convention.

TaRun -
   Added event number (ev_num) explicitly in the tree so we don't have to use scaler1_1 to get it.
   Added SendEPICSInfo( pair< string, Double_t> value, pair<string,Double_t> errvalue) to be able 
   to send feedbacks infos to the source. 	


VaAnalysis -
	 
   Changed the convention for the asymmetry sign  : L - R  


TaFdbkAna -
	 
    Derived from VaAnalysis, this is a 'TaBeamAna'  with charge asymmetry feedback implemented.
    will add PZT info if needed.	
    	
  	
	
	

* Primary changes leading to Feb 8, 2002 version
------------------------------------------------
 
TaAnalysisManager -
   Root file is now pan_%d.dat where %d = run number
   Upon initialization, the database is checked; if it is 'bad' we exit.

TaAsciiDB -
   Added GetMaxEvents()
   Added SelfCheck() - used by analysis manager.
   
TaBCM -
   Modified naming; restriction enforced that bcm1, bcm2 must be 
   different objects (not sure its a good idea but at least its clarified).

TaBeamAna -
   Uses 'bcm1r' and 'bcm1' for raw and corrected data.
   Got rid of the ifdef's since datamap iterator reset works now
      in VaAnalysis::ChanList and TIR is defined.
    
TaEvent -
   Check if event size is changing (it should not).
   Check that keys are unique within a device (see DATABASE.RULES)
   Clearer error messages if a key is not found or rule above broken.
   Provide GetADCData(slot, chan) method.
   Remove ifdef about TIR since it exists now (existence is checked).
   Add DeviceDump() to check all device data.

TaRun -
   If CHECKOUT defined, makes detailed debug printout.

TaTIR -
   Simplified.
   Add timeslot. 
   Call VaDevice::DataCopy so data shows up in Tree.

VaAnalysis -
   if CHECKOUT defined, makes detailed debug printout.
   GetMaxEvents() works now.
   datamap iterator reset before using NextDataMap, this part works now.
   Fixed a memory leak in PreProcessEvt().
 
VaDevice -
   Interface modified to accomodate above changes.
   FindHeaders() does not need a TaEvent.
