* Primary changes leading to Feb 8, 2002 version
------------------------------------------------
 
TaAnalysisManager -
   Root file is now pan_%d.dat where %d = run number
   Upon initialization, the database is checked; if it is 'bad' we exit.

TaAsciiDB -
   Added GetMaxEvents()
   Added SelfCheck() - used by analysis manager.
   
TaBCM -
   Modified naming; restriction enforced that bcm1, bcm2 must be 
   different objects (not sure its a good idea but at least its clarified).

TaBeamAna -
   Uses 'bcm1r' and 'bcm1' for raw and corrected data.
   Got rid of the ifdef's since datamap iterator reset works now
      in VaAnalysis::ChanList and TIR is defined.
    
TaEvent -
   Check if event size is changing (it should not).
   Check that keys are unique within a device (see DATABASE.RULES)
   Clearer error messages if a key is not found or rule above broken.
   Provide GetADCData(slot, chan) method.
   Remove ifdef about TIR since it exists now (existence is checked).
   Add DeviceDump() to check all device data.

TaRun -
   If CHECKOUT defined, makes detailed debug printout.

TaTIR -
   Simplified.
   Add timeslot. 
   Call VaDevice::DataCopy so data shows up in Tree.

VaAnalysis -
   if CHECKOUT defined, makes detailed debug printout.
   GetMaxEvents() works now.
   datamap iterator reset before using NextDataMap, this part works now.
   Fixed a memory leak in PreProcessEvt().
 
VaDevice -
   Interface modified to accomodate above changes.
   FindHeaders() does not need a TaEvent.
