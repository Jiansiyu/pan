Directories of this distribution:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      pan              where to run.
      pan/codaclass    CODA class library code
      pan/db           database files
      pan/doc          documentation  (including this file)
      pan/macro        ROOT macro examples
      pan/pandb        tools for interface with MySQL database
      pan/src          all sources for 'pan'
      pan/utils        miscellaneous utilities of possible use


To compile and link:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For STL support, use ROOT version 3 or higher.  Info and downloads for
ROOT at <http://root.cern.ch/root>

Pan is shipped with MAKEDICTIONARY commented out of Makefile.  If you
want to use the Pan classes from the ROOT command line you will need
MAKEDICTIONARY defined, but note that you must have ROOT version
3.02/07 or later for this to work.

You will need the CODA class library, which is in the pan/codaclass/
directory and is documented at
<http://hallaweb.jlab.org/equipment/daq/codaclass.html>.  (The version
in this distribution is modified slightly.)  The codaclass Makefile is
shipped with ONLINE commented out; you probably will want to leave it
that way since you probably do not have or need the ET library.

Compile in pan/codaclass with 'make libcoda.a' and copy resulting
library libcoda.a to the pan/src directory.  The 'DCDIR' in the
Makefile points to the codaclass directory, where to find the headers
like THaCodaFile.h.

Next, you may compile the 'pan' executible with 'make install'.  This
creates 'pan' and moves it to the pan directory.  When compiling, it
may be a good idea to do 'make clean' first.  Doing 'make clean' is
usually a good idea most of the time you compile, unless someone would
kindly fix all the Makefile dependencies perfectly (but they are
nearly perfect, I think).

To run Pan:
^^^^^^^^^^^

You may modify what files and paths Pan looks for and creates, if you
like, by defining suitable environment variables.  See below.  The
behavior described here assumes you have not done so.

Before running, you will need a 'database' file.  This is an ASCII
file in the pan/db directory which contains parameters that control
the program flow, cuts and calibrations, and the datamap.  Normally
you will use a database file created by the online system at the time
of the run, or a modified version thereof.  Failing that, there are
some database files in the pan/db directory and you can modify one as
needed.  The file name should be parityYY-XXXX.db, where YY is the
last two digits of the present year and XXXX is the four-digit run
number of the run to which the database file applies.  If Pan cannot
find this file it will try to fall back to a generic database file
called control.db in the pan directory; if it cannot find that, it
will exit.

You can invoke Pan as follows

   pan [-t] [-D database-options] [-r XXXX | -f file | -o]

Options may be given in any order.  Use "pan -r XXXX" to analyze run
number XXXX, from data file parityYY-XXXX.dat in the pan directory.
(Again YY is the current year.)  Use "pan -f file" to analyze whatever
run is in the specified file.  Use "pan -o" to analyze online data, if
you compiled with ONLINE defined.  Or use none of the above, just
"pan", to start with a ROOT prompt, from which you can invoke Pan
methods interactively or through ROOT macros.

The somewhat esoteric -t option tells Pan to do a 2-pass analysis
which in principle gives better results with less roundoff error.  In
practice the difference is usually negligible.  Use it, if at all,
with the -r or -f options only.

The -D option tells Pan to override its default database processing.
See pan/doc/DATABASE.TXT for details.

Pan will analyze the given run, producing some diagnostic outputs, and
creating a ROOT output file, parityYY_XXXX_ZZZZ.root, and an ASCII
results file, parityYY_XXXX_ZZZZ.res, both in the pan directory.  YY
and XXXX are year and run number, as above, and ZZZZ is a tag denoting
the analysis type specified in the database.  Some analyses may
produce additional ROOT files, results files, and/or output files,
with names like parityYY_XXXX_ZZZZ_WWWW.root,
parityYY_XXXX_ZZZZ_WWWW.res, and parityYY_XXXX_ZZZZ_WWWW.VVV,
respectively, where WWWW is a tag and VVV is a suffix provided by the
analysis.

The principal ROOT file contains a 'event' tree "R" and an 'pair' tree
"P".  The event tree contains raw data plus calibrated data with
keywords like 'bcm1', etc.  The pair tree contains helicity correlated
differences and asymmetries, etc.

A typical ROOT session to look at data might be:
root [0] .x ./macro/open.macro
Enter run number : 1824
root [1] raw->Draw("bcm1r:bpm4axp+bpm4axm")
root [2] asy->Draw("diff_bpm4bx")

The results file contains analysis results in a standard format; see
pan/doc/results_database.txt for details.


Environment variables:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The above file names and directories where Pan reads and writes may be
modified by setting several environment variables before running Pan.
Again, fairly reasonable behavior is obtained if you do not set any
environment variables, but if you need to do so, here is how.

If PAN_FILE_PREFIX is set, it replaces "parityYY" as the base of all
filenames.  Note that you will probably want to do this if you are
analyzing data taken before the current year; if not, then even if you
specify e.g. "-f parity02_1111.dat" on the command line, Pan will
still look for a database file called "parityYY_1111.db" (where YY is
the current year).  Setting PAN_FILE_PREFIX to "parity02" lets you
specify "-r 1111" on the command line and everything should work as
expected. 

If PAN_CODA_FILE_PATH is set, the input data file is looked for at
that path.  Likewise, if PAN_DB_FILE_PATH is set, the ASCII database
file is looked for at that path, and if PAN_ROOT_FILE_PATH,
PAN_RES_FILE_PATH, or PAN_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH is set, the ROOT file(s),
results file(s), or the other output file(s), respectively, are
written at those paths.

If PAN_CODA_FILE_SUFFIX, PAN_DB_FILE_SUFFIX, PAN_RES_FILE_SUFFIX, or
PAN_ROOT_FILE_SUFFIX is set, they replace "dat", "db", "res", or
"root", respectively, as the file suffix for the data, database,
results, or ROOT files.

To set an environment variable in the bash (or other sh-like) shell
use the command "export variable=value"; use "export -n variable" to
unset it.  In the tcsh (or other csh-like) shell use "setenv variable
value" to set, "unsetenv variable" to unset.  In either case use
"printenv variable" to examine the value of a variable.

EXAMPLE: John Gradstudent is finishing his research and just needs to
reanalyze data from the 2005 run to complete his analysis.
Unfortunately the year is now 2078, so Pan's default behavior when
invoked with "pan -r 6666" is to look for a data file called
parity78_6666.dat and a database file called parity78_6666.db.
Furthermore the data file is in the directory /adaql944/data/parity,
and John wants his ROOT, results, and output files to go to
/adaql944/work/parity.  So he does the following:

   $ export PAN_FILE_PREFIX=parity05
   $ export PAN_CODA_FILE_PATH=/adaql944/data/parity
   $ export PAN_ROOT_FILE_PATH=/adaql944/work/parity
   $ export PAN_RES_FILE_PATH=/adaql944/work/parity
   $ export PAN_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH=/adaql944/work/parity
   $ pan -r 6666

Now Pan reads data from /adaql944/data/parity/parity05_6666.dat,
writes the ROOT trees to
/adaql944/work/parity/parity05_6666_PHYSICS.root, and so on.
(Assuming Pan still works in 2078, that is.)  If John puts these in
his login file, he can analyze all the 2005 data he wants without
having to re-enter all the above at each session.

---------------- June 2002 -------------------------------------------
Here is some info regarding online feedback on charge asymmetry, etc.
---------------- June 2002 -------------------------------------------

At the start of a CODA run, an executible ~apar/feedback/panFFB
(which is simply the compiled "pan") is called with "-o" argument.                          
control.db is taken from ~apar/feedback/control.db

The code invokes the epics script ~apar/epics/epics_feedback, 
which can also be run by hand.  Eventually this may involve a
real-time feedback.

A historical log of all feedback values is kept in
     ~apar/feedback/feedback.log
The stdout and stderr output from "pan" is put in 
     ~apar/feedback/runlog/ffb_$run.log
where $run = run number, i.e. a file for each run.

At the end of a run, "pan" is killed with kill signal 31.  This 
forces "pan" to do its final end-of-run feedback and any other
stuff it wants to do at end of a run.
