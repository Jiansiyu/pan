Web documentation about code design will come soon at :
    <http://www.jlab.org/~vacheret/panam/>
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To compile and link:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For STL support, use ROOT version 3 or higher.  Info and downloads for
ROOT at <http://root.cern.ch/root>

Panam is, by default, compiled with MAKEDICTIONARY enabled. That means you
must have ROOT version 3.02/07 or later for this to work. To create the 
dictionnary Panam use LinkDef.h and generates Dict.h.   

You will need all libraries needed by Pan (See Pan README).

 - COPY main_panam.cc to main.cc FIRST
Panam used a specific makefile named makefile_panam
to compile in the Pan directory do :

 make -f makefile_panam 

It will create the executable 'panam' in the pan/ directory.

 1) To compile a version to monitor a FILE :
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
make sure you enable PANAMTEST in TaRun.cc and CODAFILETEST
in TaPanam.cc, disable ETCONNECT 
line 435 of TaPanam.cc put the run number you want.

 2) To compile an ONLINE version :
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Make sure you enable ETCONNECT in TaPanam.cc and disable 
 PANAMTEST in TaRun.cc.
In the makefile uncomment : # export ONLINE = 1 and # export OPTIMIZE =1


To run Panam:
^^^^^^^^^^^

No Pan output file is created but it requires that in the pan/db/
the 'monitor' analysis is defined in control.db. Tape at prompt :

  ./panam

The monitoring sequence is ordered as PRESTART-START-STOP-END. 
before PRESTART you can choose the channels you want to appear in the 
monitoring. WHEN PRESTART you can turn off/on the canvas (off means 
iconified).You can START the monitoring or go to END if not HAPPY with 
channels.you can just STOP the monitoring at any time or END directly. 
Sometimes PANAM hang when STOP...I will try to understand what. END looks 
safer. Anyway, I will need a period of test to understand the behaviour in 
real conditions.  Also, we will perhaps need to modify the code about ET 
so Pan doesn't time out when coda finish. It will save works to users : 
they will not have to prestart the sequence.... You can EXIT at any time. 
you can resize canvas, zoom in-out on histos as you wish.

 
 !!! NOTES about VERSION 1.0 !!!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Panam is toward a working version I think, it still empty pieces and 
other things to fix
but it should work online and stay stable for a couple of hour. Please 
read these important notes of the current Panam status.

1. Since the DAQs are not "unified" and detectors are not yet installed,
some devices are not working and other not properly defined.
Example is 'bpm4bxws': it is not defined yet.( by the way, I would prefer 
we rename them bpmws4bx, it is 
much easier for generic search in my lists of devices). So in summary 
what works is :

- what I call "time signals" (if you have other way of calling it 
I'll take it!) 
- parity DAQ ADCs 0->9
- BCM1,BCM2,BCM3(unser) data,asym,all
- HALL A BPMS (12,10,8,4A,4B) data,diffs,all
- LUMI  

I have not yet verified the integrity of all channels ! 

2. When you unselect a device before PRESTART, this may cause a crash because 
 it seems there is some problem of communication between STL vectors and 
ROOT Frames. It's 
look like the vector is not correctly updated when selecting-unselecting 
many times. So 
avoid doing this as much as you can. I will fix that.

3. Feedback and dithering canvas are empty. For feedback I wanted to 
display something like
runbird do so now instead, there is a commented call to runbird 
(which is less work for me anyway :-)).
I will implement the integrated asymmetries and diffs very soon. For 
Dithering We will need to discuss
what to plot in it but I was thinking about sometihng like in Wilson M. 
thesis p 38. 1 BPM XY, DAC values, enrgy BPM and 
det/bcm.
 
4. DO NOT exit a canvas when in START mode (I mean clicking on the cross). 
I found a way but not completly coded right now (to avoid a seg fault when 
somebody is doing this),this is number one on my list of fixes. I look for 
a way to block any access to canvas instead of 
testing all the time if the canvas is still alive.
 

5. The Embended canvas feature is not working yet. I don't think it is a 
big issue right now so I leave it for later. 

   
6. Last tests showed that when too many histos are displayed in a canvas, 
some of them doesn't have time to fill up. So don't try to display to 
much at the same time. I noticed also that Stack of histos seems quicker 
so that can be a way to avoid the problem.
