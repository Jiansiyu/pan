   ==============

Please use the "ext" access method instead of "pserver", with ssh as 
the login protocol.  The old "pserver" method used clear text passwords
which is a security hazard and should be avoided.  If you have used 
"pserver" before, delete ~/.cvspass which contains the the poorly-encrypted 
password.

In your local login script (.cshrc, .bash_profile), delete any definition 
of CVSROOT.  You do not need to set CVSROOT explicitly; it will be stored 
locally in the checked-out directory tree and only needs to be given once 
at checkout time (see below).

In the login script, define CVS_RSH as follows:

For bash:
% export CVS_RSH=ssh

For csh/tcsh:
% setenv CVS_RSH ssh

You are basically done. To check out the repository, do

% cvs -d ":ext:user@jlabs1.jlab.org:/group/halla/parity/cvs" checkout pan

Of course, replace "user" in the above command with your CUE username.
You can now use CVS as usual.  

You will notice that you now have to enter your password for every
CVS command that requires access to the server.  This is inconvenient,
but can be avoided if you set up ssh keys.  Doing so is a bit involved.

Anyone with a CUE account may read the repository. However, only a limited 
set of users have write access. If you want to contribute and need full access, 
please contact Bob Michaels.

For more on CVS usage, see the free CVS book at www.cvshome.org, and I have
a copy too, at:
