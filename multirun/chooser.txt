# Configuration file for a multirun analysis, used by the TaVarChooser class
# All lines beginning with a # are treated as a comment (not read in).
# First column is always the type of variable to readout (case insensitive),
#   followed by a switch (1==on, 0==off) or a set of specific
#   variables to be included.
# By default, all options are 0 (off).

# Battery readout (on/off): diff

# BPM positions used for dithering (bpm position) : avg and diff
ditbpms 12x 4ax 4ay 4bx 4by

# Other BPMs (bpms): avg and diff
# bpms 1 8 10

# Decision to use dithering bpms for a bpm saturation cut (on/off).
#  These bpms are hardwired in TaPairSelector:
